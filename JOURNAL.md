## 10/19/2025 - Planning Out Main Parts  

Scouring through the vast internet for what motors to use. I finally settled on a DC Gear Motor with an encoder.![Screenshot 2025-10-19 204812.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM1NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0db7ad8dbbd8c03eb761225aefc1cc839c13bbe4/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20204812.jpg)
 They will be a bit more harder to use as I will have to write my own PID loop and tune all the variables. I will also be using Aluminum T-slot extrusions as they are cheap, light and strong.

For the processing I probably will be using a Raspberry Pi 5. I already have one and can use that. I will be getting help from the printing legion to help me print custom plastic pieces that will join the other parts together.
